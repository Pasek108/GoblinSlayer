  <summary>❓Why sounds starts playing after first click and not when I open the page❓</summary>
  It's because auto playing sounds is blocked by browser until the user interact with the document.

  <summary>❓Why my commits often have no names and I'm not using branches❓</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>I often create with bursts many things at once</li>
    <li>I don't plan things ahead, I just create things that seems good at that moment</li>
    <li>Sometimes I have bad internet connection and it is troublesome to send commits</li>
    <li>I'm coding alone so creating branches and describing commits is not useful for me</li>

#### Credits
![credits](/_for_readme/credits.png)
Credits page contains 2 sections with links for resources used in the project and link to my github

----------------------------------

#### Game
![in game](/_for_readme/game.png)
At the top of the game view are wave and killed goblins counters and at the bottom is an instruction on what keys are used to play the game.

The way the game works is simple:
- Player is standing in the middle
- Game generates random waves of goblins which runs towards the player
- Player has to use keys A and D to face left or right direction
- If player is facing goblin direction, he will kill the goblin, otherwise player will lose
- When player clears a wave, new one is generated with more goblins that are faster

----------------------------------

#### Game over
![game over](/_for_readme/game_over.png)
Game over view displays survived waves, killed goblins and button that goes back to main menu

----------------------------------
